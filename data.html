    <p>When tickets for Jay Chou’s long-awaited Taiwan concert went on sale, the online ticketing platform crashed almost instantly, leaving thousands of fans staring helplessly at a loading screen. Tickets sold out within just a few minutes—yet almost as quickly, they began surfacing in private resale groups. Some of these tickets were priced as high as NT$300,000 (approximately US$9,200), according to a report by United Daily News (UDN). 
    </p>
    <p>This incident triggered widespread debate over ticket scalping and fairness in Taiwan’s concert market. Despite soaring prices, many fans remain willing to pay scalpers extreme amounts just to see their idols, highlighting both a growing imbalance between supply and demand in Taiwan’s ticketing ecosystem, as well as fans’ hunger for live performances.</p>

    <h2>Widening Gap Between Concert Ticket Supply and Demand Fuels Scalping</h2>

    <p>Kuan-Tsung Chiu, the CEO of ticketing platform TixCraft, said the rise in scalping is a direct result of market dynamics. “Scalpers profit from the gap between face value and what consumers are willing to pay,” he explained. “If tickets are gone in seconds and resale prices soar, that’s a sign the original pricing was too low.” Chiu believes that the core problem isn’t scalping itself, but the supply-demand mismatch. He notes an event with just 10,000 seats that had to fend off millions of ticket scalping bots as a recent example of the imbalance.

    <p>Chiu also points to the limited number of concert dates and flawed allocation of public event spaces as contributing factors in the affordability and availability of tickets. He explains that while ticketing companies often recommend that organizers add more shows, government assessments always result in only one or two additional performances. Moreover, major acts are sometimes assigned to smaller venues, while larger spaces remain unused. Tai-Ying Li, Section Chief of Taipei’s Department of Cultural Affairs, acknowledged that the government prioritizes local performers over international performers; ticket sales are just one of several criteria in their consideration. However, scheduling popular artists to perform in relatively small venues exacerbates the ticket shortage, making ticket scalping inevitable.
